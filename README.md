# Easy Trader (Stock Trading Application)

CUNY Tech Prep Final Project

Easy Trader is a stock market simulator with a beginner friendly UI. Users get to practice trading with virtual money to sharpen their knowledge of how the stock market works.
As the user logs into his/her account, they are greeted with a welcoming home page that displays recommended stocks they can choose to invest in. The user can get more details on individual stocks by searching for the stock specific ticker symbol. 
Once a user invests in a stock, that stock is added to their portfolio. The userâ€™s portfolio keeps the user up to date with their investments, and gives them the option to buy/sell shares.
